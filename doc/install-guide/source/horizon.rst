The OpenStack Dashboard, also known as
`horizon <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/horizon>`__
is a web interface that enables cloud administrators
and users to manage various OpenStack resources and services.

The Dashboard enables web-based interactions with the
OpenStack Compute cloud controller through the OpenStack APIs.

Horizon enables you to customize the brand of the dashboard.

Horizon provides a set of core classes and reusable templates and tools.

This example deployment uses an Apache web server.

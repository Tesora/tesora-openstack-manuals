Abstract
~~~~~~~~

The OpenStack system consists of several key services that are separately
installed. These services work together depending on your cloud
needs. These services include Compute service, Identity service,
Networking service, Image service, Block Storage service, Object Storage
service, Telemetry service, Orchestration service, and Database service. You
can install any of these projects separately and configure them stand-alone
or as connected entities.

=====================
Configure the EC2 API
=====================

You can set options in the ``nova.conf`` configuration file
to control which network address and port the EC2 API listens on,
the formatting of some API responses, and authentication related options.

To customize these options for OpenStack EC2 API, use the configuration
option settings documented in the table :ref:`nova-ec2`.

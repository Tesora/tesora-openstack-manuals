Configure authentication and authorization
==========================================

There are different methods of authentication for the
OpenStack Compute project, including no authentication.
The preferred system is the OpenStack Identity service,
code-named keystone.

To customize authorization settings for Compute, use the configuration
options documented in the table :ref:`nova-authentication`.

To customize certificate authority settings for Compute, use the
configuration options documented in the table :ref:`nova-ca`.

To customize Compute and the Identity service to use LDAP as a backend,
refer to the configuration options documented in the table :ref:`nova-ldap`".

Cross-origin resource sharing
=============================

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows code running in
a browser (JavaScript for example) to make requests to a domain, other than the
one it was originated from. OpenStack services support CORS requests.

For more information, see `cross-project features
<http://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide/cross-project.html>`_
in OpenStack Administrator Guide, `CORS in Dashboard
<http://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/dashboard/cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors.html>`_,
and `CORS in Object Storage service
<http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/cors.html>`_.

For a complete list of all available CORS configuration options,
see `CORS configuration options
<http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.middleware/cors.html#configuration-options>`_.

Compute relies on an external image service to store virtual machine images and
maintain a catalog of available images. By default, Compute is configured to
use the Image service (glance), which is currently the only supported image
service.

If your installation requires :command:`euca2ools` to register new images, you
must run the ``nova-objectstore`` service. This service provides an Amazon S3
front end for the Image service, which is required by :command:`euca2ools`.

To customize the Compute service, use the configuration option settings
documented in :ref:`nova-glance` and :ref:`nova-s3`.

You can modify many options in the Image service. The following tables provide
a comprehensive list.

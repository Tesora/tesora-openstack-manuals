     - (Integer) Number of seconds after downloading an image via BitTorrent that it should be seeded for other peers.
   * - ``use_agent_default`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Determines if the XenAPI agent should be used when the image used does not contain a hint to declare if the agent is present or not. The hint is a glance property "xenapi_use_agent" that has the value "True" or "False". Note that waiting for the agent when it is not present will significantly increase server boot times.

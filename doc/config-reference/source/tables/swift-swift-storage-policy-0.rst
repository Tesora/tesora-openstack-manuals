.. list-table:: Description of configuration options for ``[storage-policy-0]`` in ``swift.conf``
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - ``default`` = ``yes``
     - 0 means to not use a per-disk thread pool. It is recommended to keep this value small, as large values can result in high read latencies due to large queue depths. A good starting point is 4 threads per disk.
   * - ``name`` = ``Policy-0``
     - No help text available for this option.
   * - ``policy_type`` = ``replication``
     - No help text available for this option.

.. list-table:: Description of glance configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[glance]**
     -
   * - ``allowed_direct_url_schemes`` =
     - (ListOpt) A list of URL schemes that can be downloaded directly via the direct_url. Currently supported schemes: [file].
   * - ``auth_strategy`` = ``keystone``
     - (StrOpt) Authentication strategy to use when connecting to glance. Only "keystone" and "noauth" are currently supported by ironic.
   * - ``glance_api_insecure`` = ``False``
     - (BoolOpt) Allow to perform insecure SSL (https) requests to glance.
   * - ``glance_api_servers`` = ``None``
     - (ListOpt) A list of the glance api servers available to ironic. Prefix with https:// for SSL-based glance API servers. Format is [hostname|IP]:port.
   * - ``glance_host`` = ``$my_ip``
     - (StrOpt) Default glance hostname or IP address.
   * - ``glance_num_retries`` = ``0``
     - (IntOpt) Number of retries when downloading an image from glance.
   * - ``glance_port`` = ``9292``
     - (PortOpt) Default glance port.
   * - ``glance_protocol`` = ``http``
     - (StrOpt) Default protocol to use when connecting to glance. Set to https for SSL.
   * - ``swift_account`` = ``None``
     - (StrOpt) The account that Glance uses to communicate with Swift. The format is "AUTH_uuid". "uuid" is the UUID for the account configured in the glance-api.conf. Required for temporary URLs when Glance backend is Swift. For example: "AUTH_a422b2-91f3-2f46-74b7-d7c9e8958f5d30". Swift temporary URL format: "endpoint_url/api_version/[account/]container/object_id"
   * - ``swift_api_version`` = ``v1``
     - (StrOpt) The Swift API version to create a temporary URL for. Defaults to "v1". Swift temporary URL format: "endpoint_url/api_version/[account/]container/object_id"
   * - ``swift_container`` = ``glance``
     - (StrOpt) The Swift container Glance is configured to store its images in. Defaults to "glance", which is the default in glance-api.conf. Swift temporary URL format: "endpoint_url/api_version/[account/]container/object_id"
   * - ``swift_endpoint_url`` = ``None``
     - (StrOpt) The "endpoint" (scheme, hostname, optional port) for the Swift URL of the form "endpoint_url/api_version/[account/]container/object_id". Do not include trailing "/". For example, use "https://swift.example.com". If using RADOS Gateway, endpoint may also contain /swift path; if it does not, it will be appended. Required for temporary URLs.
   * - ``swift_store_multiple_containers_seed`` = ``0``
     - (IntOpt) This should match a config by the same name in the Glance configuration file. When set to 0, a single-tenant store will only use one container to store all images. When set to an integer value between 1 and 32, a single-tenant store will use multiple containers to store images, and this value will determine how many containers are created.
   * - ``swift_temp_url_duration`` = ``1200``
     - (IntOpt) The length of time in seconds that the temporary URL will be valid for. Defaults to 20 minutes. If some deploys get a 401 response code when trying to download from the temporary URL, try raising this duration.
   * - ``swift_temp_url_key`` = ``None``
     - (StrOpt) The secret token given to Swift to allow temporary URL downloads. Required for temporary URLs.
   * - ``temp_url_endpoint_type`` = ``swift``
     - (StrOpt) Type of endpoint to use for temporary URLs. If the Glance backend is Swift, use "swift"; if it is CEPH with RADOS gateway, use "radosgw".

   * - ``cert_topic`` = ``cert``
     - (String) DEPRECATED: Determines the RPC topic that the cert nodes listen on. For most deployments there is no need to ever change it. Since the nova-cert service is marked for deprecation, the feature to change RPC topic that cert nodes listen may be removed as early as the 15.0.0

.. list-table:: Description of API configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[DEFAULT]**
     -
   * - ``api_paste_config`` = ``api-paste.ini``
     - (String) File name for the paste.deploy config for nova-api
   * - ``api_rate_limit`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Whether to use per-user rate limiting for the api. This option is only used by v2 api. Rate limiting is removed from v2.1 api.
   * - ``client_socket_timeout`` = ``900``
     - (Integer) Timeout for client connections' socket operations. If an incoming connection is idle for this number of seconds it will be closed. A value of '0' means wait forever.
   * - ``enable_new_services`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) Services to be added to the available pool on create
   * - ``enabled_apis`` = ``osapi_compute, metadata``
     - (List) A list of APIs to enable by default
   * - ``enabled_ssl_apis`` =
     - (List) A list of APIs with enabled SSL
   * - ``instance_name_template`` = ``instance-%08x``
     - (String) Template string to be used to generate instance names
   * - ``max_header_line`` = ``16384``
     - (Integer) Maximum line size of message headers to be accepted. max_header_line may need to be increased when using large tokens (typically those generated by the Keystone v3 API with big service catalogs).
   * - ``multi_instance_display_name_template`` = ``%(name)s-%(count)d``
     - (String) When creating multiple instances with a single request using the os-multiple-create API extension, this template will be used to build the display name for each instance. The benefit is that the instances end up with different hostnames. To restore legacy behavior of every instance having the same name, set this option to "%(name)s". Valid keys for the template are: name, uuid, count.
   * - ``non_inheritable_image_properties`` = ``cache_in_nova, bittorrent``
     - (List) These are image properties which a snapshot should not inherit from an instance
   * - ``null_kernel`` = ``nokernel``
     - (String) Kernel image that indicates not to use a kernel, but to use a raw disk image instead
   * - ``osapi_compute_ext_list`` =
     - (List) DEPRECATED: Specify list of extensions to load when using osapi_compute_extension option with nova.api.openstack.compute.legacy_v2.contrib.select_extensions This option will be removed in the near future. After that point you have to run all of the API.
   * - ``osapi_compute_extension`` = ``['nova.api.openstack.compute.legacy_v2.contrib.standard_extensions']``
     - (Multi-valued) DEPRECATED: osapi compute extension to load. This option will be removed in the near future. After that point you have to run all of the API.
   * - ``osapi_compute_link_prefix`` = ``None``
     - (String) Base URL that will be presented to users in links to the OpenStack Compute API
   * - ``osapi_compute_listen`` = ``0.0.0.0``
     - (String) The IP address on which the OpenStack API will listen.
   * - ``osapi_compute_listen_port`` = ``8774``
     - (Integer) The port on which the OpenStack API will listen.
   * - ``osapi_compute_workers`` = ``None``
     - (Integer) Number of workers for OpenStack API service. The default will be the number of CPUs available.
   * - ``osapi_hide_server_address_states`` = ``building``
     - (List) List of instance states that should hide network info
   * - ``secure_proxy_ssl_header`` = ``None``
     - (String) The HTTP header used to determine the scheme for the original request, even if it was removed by an SSL terminating proxy. Typical value is "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO".
   * - ``servicegroup_driver`` = ``db``
     - (String) The driver for servicegroup service.
   * - ``snapshot_name_template`` = ``snapshot-%s``
     - (String) Template string to be used to generate snapshot names
   * - ``tcp_keepidle`` = ``600``

   * - ``use_forwarded_for`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Treat X-Forwarded-For as the canonical remote address. Only enable this if you have a sanitizing proxy.
   * - ``wsgi_default_pool_size`` = ``1000``
     - (Integer) Size of the pool of greenthreads used by wsgi
   * - ``wsgi_keep_alive`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) If False, closes the client socket connection explicitly.
   * - ``wsgi_log_format`` = ``%(client_ip)s "%(request_line)s" status: %(status_code)s len: %(body_length)s time: %(wall_seconds).7f``
     - (String) A python format string that is used as the template to generate log lines. The following values can be formatted into it: client_ip, date_time, request_line, status_code, body_length, wall_seconds.
   * - **[oslo_middleware]**
     -
   * - ``max_request_body_size`` = ``114688``
     - (Integer) The maximum body size for each request, in bytes.
   * - ``secure_proxy_ssl_header`` = ``X-Forwarded-Proto``
     - (String) DEPRECATED: The HTTP Header that will be used to determine what the original request protocol scheme was, even if it was hidden by an SSL termination proxy.

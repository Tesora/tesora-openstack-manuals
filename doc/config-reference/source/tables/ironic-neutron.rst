     - (Unknown) Config Section from which to load plugin specific options
   * - ``auth_strategy`` = ``keystone``

     - (String) PEM encoded client certificate cert file
   * - ``cleaning_network_uuid`` = ``None``
     - (String) Neutron network UUID for the ramdisk to be booted into for cleaning nodes. Required for "neutron" network interface. It is also required if cleaning nodes when using "flat" network interface or "neutron" DHCP provider.
   * - ``insecure`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Verify HTTPS connections.
   * - ``keyfile`` = ``None``
     - (String) PEM encoded client certificate key file

   * - ``timeout`` = ``None``
     - (Integer) Timeout value for http requests
   * - ``url`` = ``None``
     - (String) URL for connecting to neutron. Default value translates to 'http://$my_ip:9696' when auth_strategy is 'noauth', and to discovery from Keystone catalog when auth_strategy is 'keystone'.
   * - ``url_timeout`` = ``30``
     - (Integer) Timeout value for connecting to neutron in seconds.

.. list-table:: Description of policy configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[DEFAULT]**
     -
   * - ``allow_instance_snapshots`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) Operators can turn off the ability for a user to take snapshots of their instances by setting this option to False. When disabled, any attempt to take a snapshot will result in a HTTP 400 response ("Bad Request").
   * - ``allow_resize_to_same_host`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Allow destination machine to match source for resize. Useful when testing in single-host environments. By default it is not allowed to resize to the same host. Setting this option to true will add the same host to the destination options.
   * - ``max_age`` = ``0``
     - (Integer) The number of seconds between subsequent usage refreshes. This defaults to 0 (off) to avoid additional load but it is useful to turn on to help keep quota usage up-to-date and reduce the impact of out of sync usage issues. Note that quotas are not updated on a periodic task, they will update on a new reservation if max_age has passed since the last reservation.

       Possible values:

        * 0 (default) or any positive integer representing number of seconds.
   * - ``max_local_block_devices`` = ``3``
     - (Integer) Maximum number of devices that will result in a local image being created on the hypervisor node.

       A negative number means unlimited. Setting max_local_block_devices to 0 means that any request that attempts to create a local disk will fail. This option is meant to limit the number of local discs (so root local disc that is the result of --image being used, and any other ephemeral and swap disks). 0 does not mean that images will be automatically converted to volumes and boot instances from volumes - it just means that all requests that attempt to create a local disk will fail.

       Possible values:

       * 0: Creating a local disk is not allowed.

       * Negative number: Allows unlimited number of local discs.

       * Positive number: Allows only these many number of local discs. (Default value is 3).
   * - ``osapi_compute_unique_server_name_scope`` =
     - (String) Sets the scope of the check for unique instance names.

       The default doesn't check for unique names. If a scope for the name check is set, a launch of a new instance or an update of an existing instance with a duplicate name will result in an ''InstanceExists'' error. The uniqueness is case-insensitive. Setting this option can increase the usability for end users as they don't have to distinguish among instances with the same name by their IDs.

       Possible values:

       * '': An empty value means that no uniqueness check is done and duplicate names are possible.

       * "project": The instance name check is done only for instances within the same project.

       * "global": The instance name check is done for all instances regardless of the project.
   * - ``osapi_max_limit`` = ``1000``
     - (Integer) As a query can potentially return many thousands of items, you can limit the maximum number of items in a single response by setting this option.
   * - ``password_length`` = ``12``
     - (Integer) Length of generated instance admin passwords.
   * - ``reservation_expire`` = ``86400``
     - (Integer) The number of seconds until a reservation expires. It represents the time period for invalidating quota reservations.

       Possible values:

        * 86400 (default) or any positive integer representing number of seconds.
   * - ``resize_fs_using_block_device`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) If enabled, attempt to resize the filesystem by accessing the image over a block device. This is done by the host and may not be necessary if the image contains a recent version of cloud-init. Possible mechanisms require the nbd driver (for qcow and raw), or loop (for raw).
   * - ``until_refresh`` = ``0``
     - (Integer) The count of reservations until usage is refreshed. This defaults to 0 (off) to avoid additional load but it is useful to turn on to help keep quota usage up-to-date and reduce the impact of out of sync usage issues.

       Possible values:

        * 0 (default) or any positive integer.

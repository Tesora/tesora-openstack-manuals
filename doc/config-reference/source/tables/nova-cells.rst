   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[cells]**
     -
   * - ``call_timeout`` = ``60``
     - (IntOpt) Seconds to wait for response from a call to a cell.
   * - ``capabilities`` = ``hypervisor=xenserver;kvm, os=linux;windows``
     - (ListOpt) Key/Multi-value list with the capabilities of the cell
   * - ``cell_type`` = ``compute``
     - (StrOpt) Type of cell
   * - ``cells_config`` = ``None``
     - (StrOpt) Configuration file from which to read cells configuration. If given, overrides reading cells from the database.
   * - ``db_check_interval`` = ``60``
     - (IntOpt) Interval, in seconds, for getting fresh cell information from the database.
   * - ``driver`` = ``nova.cells.rpc_driver.CellsRPCDriver``
     - (StrOpt) Cells communication driver to use
   * - ``enable`` = ``False``
     - (BoolOpt) Enable cell functionality
   * - ``instance_update_num_instances`` = ``1``
     - (IntOpt) Number of instances to update per periodic task run
   * - ``instance_update_sync_database_limit`` = ``100``
     - (IntOpt) Number of instances to pull from the database at one time for a sync. If there are more instances to update the results will be paged through
   * - ``instance_updated_at_threshold`` = ``3600``
     - (IntOpt) Number of seconds after an instance was updated or deleted to continue to update cells
   * - ``manager`` = ``nova.cells.manager.CellsManager``
     - (StrOpt) Manager for cells
   * - ``max_hop_count`` = ``10``
     - (IntOpt) Maximum number of hops for cells routing.
   * - ``mute_child_interval`` = ``300``
     - (IntOpt) Number of seconds after which a lack of capability and capacity updates signals the child cell is to be treated as a mute.
   * - ``mute_weight_multiplier`` = ``-10000.0``
     - (FloatOpt) Multiplier used to weigh mute children. (The value should be negative.)
   * - ``name`` = ``nova``
     - (StrOpt) Name of this cell
   * - ``offset_weight_multiplier`` = ``1.0``
     - (FloatOpt) Multiplier used to weigh offset weigher.
   * - ``reserve_percent`` = ``10.0``
     - (FloatOpt) Percentage of cell capacity to hold in reserve. Affects both memory and disk utilization
   * - ``topic`` = ``cells``
     - (StrOpt) The topic cells nodes listen on

.. list-table:: Description of cell configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[cells]**
     -
   * - ``call_timeout`` = ``60``
     - (Integer) Call timeout

       Cell messaging module waits for response(s) to be put into the eventlet queue. This option defines the seconds waited for response from a call to a cell.

       Possible values:

       * Time in seconds.
   * - ``capabilities`` = ``hypervisor=xenserver;kvm, os=linux;windows``
     - (List) Cell capabilities

       List of arbitrary key=value pairs defining capabilities of the current cell to be sent to the parent cells. These capabilities are intended to be used in cells scheduler filters/weighers.

       Possible values:

       * key=value pairs list for example; ``hypervisor=xenserver;kvm,os=linux;windows``
   * - ``cell_type`` = ``compute``
     - (String) Type of cell

       When cells feature is enabled the hosts in the OpenStack Compute cloud are partitioned into groups. Cells are configured as a tree. The top-level cell's cell_type must be set to ``api``. All other cells are defined as a ``compute cell`` by default.

       Related options:

       * compute_api_class: This option must be set to cells api driver for the top-level cell (nova.compute.cells_api.ComputeCellsAPI)

       * quota_driver: Disable quota checking for the child cells. (nova.quota.NoopQuotaDriver)
   * - ``cells_config`` = ``None``
     - (String) Optional cells configuration

       Configuration file from which to read cells configuration. If given, overrides reading cells from the database.

       Cells store all inter-cell communication data, including user names and passwords, in the database. Because the cells data is not updated very frequently, use this option to specify a JSON file to store cells data. With this configuration, the database is no longer consulted when reloading the cells data. The file must have columns present in the Cell model (excluding common database fields and the id column). You must specify the queue connection information through a transport_url field, instead of username, password, and so on.

       The transport_url has the following form: rabbit://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME:PORT/VIRTUAL_HOST

       Possible values:

       The scheme can be either qpid or rabbit, the following sample shows this optional configuration:

        { "parent": { "name": "parent", "api_url": "http://api.example.com:8774", "transport_url": "rabbit://rabbit.example.com", "weight_offset": 0.0, "weight_scale": 1.0, "is_parent": true }, "cell1": { "name": "cell1", "api_url": "http://api.example.com:8774", "transport_url": "rabbit://rabbit1.example.com", "weight_offset": 0.0, "weight_scale": 1.0, "is_parent": false }, "cell2": { "name": "cell2", "api_url": "http://api.example.com:8774", "transport_url": "rabbit://rabbit2.example.com", "weight_offset": 0.0, "weight_scale": 1.0, "is_parent": false } }
   * - ``db_check_interval`` = ``60``
     - (Integer) DB check interval

       Cell state manager updates cell status for all cells from the DB only after this particular interval time is passed. Otherwise cached status are used. If this value is 0 or negative all cell status are updated from the DB whenever a state is needed.

       Possible values:

       * Interval time, in seconds.
   * - ``driver`` = ``nova.cells.rpc_driver.CellsRPCDriver``
     - (String) DEPRECATED: Cells communication driver

       Driver for cell<->cell communication via RPC. This is used to setup the RPC consumers as well as to send a message to another cell. 'nova.cells.rpc_driver.CellsRPCDriver' starts up 2 separate servers for handling inter-cell communication via RPC. The only available driver is the RPC driver.
   * - ``enable`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Enable cell functionality

       When this functionality is enabled, it lets you to scale an OpenStack Compute cloud in a more distributed fashion without having to use complicated technologies like database and message queue clustering. Cells are configured as a tree. The top-level cell should have a host that runs a nova-api service, but no nova-compute services. Each child cell should run all of the typical nova-* services in a regular Compute cloud except for nova-api. You can think of cells as a normal Compute deployment in that each cell has its own database server and message queue broker.

       Related options:

       * name: A unique cell name must be given when this functionality is enabled.

       * cell_type: Cell type should be defined for all cells.
   * - ``instance_update_num_instances`` = ``1``
     - (Integer) Instance update num instances

       On every run of the periodic task, nova cells manager will attempt to sync instance_updated_at_threshold number of instances. When the manager gets the list of instances, it shuffles them so that multiple nova-cells services do not attempt to sync the same instances in lockstep.

       Possible values:

       * Positive integer number

       Related options:

       * This value is used with the ``instance_updated_at_threshold`` value in a periodic task run.
   * - ``instance_update_sync_database_limit`` = ``100``
     - (Integer) Instance update sync database limit

       Number of instances to pull from the database at one time for a sync. If there are more instances to update the results will be paged through.

       Possible values:

       * Number of instances.
   * - ``instance_updated_at_threshold`` = ``3600``
     - (Integer) Instance updated at threshold

       Number of seconds after an instance was updated or deleted to continue to update cells. This option lets cells manager to only attempt to sync instances that have been updated recently. i.e., a threshold of 3600 means to only update instances that have modified in the last hour.

       Possible values:

       * Threshold in seconds

       Related options:

       * This value is used with the ``instance_update_num_instances`` value in a periodic task run.
   * - ``max_hop_count`` = ``10``
     - (Integer) Maximum hop count

       When processing a targeted message, if the local cell is not the target, a route is defined between neighbouring cells. And the message is processed across the whole routing path. This option defines the maximum hop counts until reaching the target.

       Possible values:

       * Positive integer value
   * - ``mute_child_interval`` = ``300``
     - (Integer) Mute child interval

       Number of seconds after which a lack of capability and capacity update the child cell is to be treated as a mute cell. Then the child cell will be weighed as recommend highly that it be skipped.

       Possible values:

       * Time in seconds.
   * - ``mute_weight_multiplier`` = ``-10000.0``
     - (Floating point) Mute weight multiplier

       Multiplier used to weigh mute children. Mute children cells are recommended to be skipped so their weight is multiplied by this negative value.

       Possible values:

       * Negative numeric number
   * - ``name`` = ``nova``
     - (String) Name of the current cell

       This value must be unique for each cell. Name of a cell is used as its id, leaving this option unset or setting the same name for two or more cells may cause unexpected behaviour.

       Related options:

       * enabled: This option is meaningful only when cells service is enabled
   * - ``offset_weight_multiplier`` = ``1.0``
     - (Floating point) Offset weight multiplier

       Multiplier used to weigh offset weigher. Cells with higher weight_offsets in the DB will be preferred. The weight_offset is a property of a cell stored in the database. It can be used by a deployer to have scheduling decisions favor or disfavor cells based on the setting.

       Possible values:

       * Numeric multiplier
   * - ``reserve_percent`` = ``10.0``
     - (Floating point) Reserve percentage

       Percentage of cell capacity to hold in reserve, so the minimum amount of free resource is considered to be; min_free = total * (reserve_percent / 100.0) This option affects both memory and disk utilization. The primary purpose of this reserve is to ensure some space is available for users who want to resize their instance to be larger. Note that currently once the capacity expands into this reserve space this option is ignored.
   * - ``rpc_driver_queue_base`` = ``cells.intercell``
     - (String) RPC driver queue base

       When sending a message to another cell by JSON-ifying the message and making an RPC cast to 'process_message', a base queue is used. This option defines the base queue name to be used when communicating between cells. Various topics by message type will be appended to this.

       Possible values:

       * The base queue name to be used when communicating between cells.
   * - ``topic`` = ``cells``
     - (String) Topic

       This is the message queue topic that cells nodes listen on. It is used when the cells service is started up to configure the queue, and whenever an RPC call to the scheduler is made.

       Possible values:

       * cells: This is the recommended and the default value.

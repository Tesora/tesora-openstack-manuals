.. list-table:: Description of IPv6 configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[DEFAULT]**
     -
   * - ``fixed_range_v6`` = ``fd00::/48``
     - (String) This option determines the fixed IPv6 address block when creating a network.

       Please note that this option is only used when using nova-network instead of Neutron in your deployment.

       Possible values:

        Any valid IPv6 CIDR. The default value is "fd00::/48".

       Related options:

        ``use_neutron``
   * - ``gateway_v6`` = ``None``
     - (String) This is the default IPv6 gateway. It is used only in the testing suite.

       Please note that this option is only used when using nova-network instead of Neutron in your deployment.

       Possible values:

        Any valid IP address.

       Related options:

        ``use_neutron``, ``gateway``
   * - ``ipv6_backend`` = ``rfc2462``
     - (String) Abstracts out IPv6 address generation to pluggable backends.

       nova-network can be put into dual-stack mode, so that it uses both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. In dual-stack mode, by default, instances acquire IPv6 global unicast addresses with the help of stateless address auto-configuration mechanism.

       Related options:

       * use_neutron: this option only works with nova-network.

       * use_ipv6: this option only works if ipv6 is enabled for nova-network.
   * - ``use_ipv6`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Assign IPv6 and IPv4 addresses when creating instances.

       * use_neutron: this only works with nova-network.

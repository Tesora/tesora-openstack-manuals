   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[glance_store]**
     -
   * - ``cinder_api_insecure`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Allow to perform insecure SSL requests to cinder.$sentinal$If this option is set to True, HTTPS endpoint connection is verified using the CA certificates file specified by ``cinder_ca_certificates_file`` option.$sentinal$Possible values: * True * False$sentinal$Related options: * cinder_ca_certificates_file
   * - ``cinder_ca_certificates_file`` = ``None``
     - (String) Location of a CA certificates file used for cinder client requests.$sentinal$The specified CA certificates file, if set, is used to verify cinder connections via HTTPS endpoint. If the endpoint is HTTP, this value is ignored. ``cinder_api_insecure`` must be set to ``True`` to enable the verification.$sentinal$Possible values: * Path to a ca certificates file$sentinal$Related options: * cinder_api_insecure
   * - ``cinder_catalog_info`` = ``volumev2::publicURL``
     - (String) Information to match when looking for cinder in the service catalog.$sentinal$When the ``cinder_endpoint_template`` is not set and any of ``cinder_store_auth_address``, ``cinder_store_user_name``, ``cinder_store_project_name``, ``cinder_store_password`` is not set, cinder store uses this information to lookup cinder endpoint from the service catalog in the current context. ``cinder_os_region_name``, if set, is taken into consideration to fetch the appropriate endpoint.$sentinal$The service catalog can be listed by the ``openstack catalog list`` command.$sentinal$Possible values: * A string of of the following form: ``<service_type>:<service_name>:<endpoint_type>`` At least ``service_type`` and ``endpoint_type`` should be specified. ``service_name`` can be omitted.$sentinal$Related options: * cinder_os_region_name * cinder_endpoint_template * cinder_store_auth_address * cinder_store_user_name * cinder_store_project_name * cinder_store_password
   * - ``cinder_endpoint_template`` = ``None``
     - (String) Override service catalog lookup with template for cinder endpoint.$sentinal$When this option is set, this value is used to generate cinder endpoint, instead of looking up from the service catalog. This value is ignored if ``cinder_store_auth_address``, ``cinder_store_user_name``, ``cinder_store_project_name``, and ``cinder_store_password`` are specified.$sentinal$If this configuration option is set, ``cinder_catalog_info`` will be ignored.$sentinal$Possible values: * URL template string for cinder endpoint, where ``%%(tenant)s`` is replaced with the current tenant (project) name. For example: ``http://cinder.openstack.example.org/v2/%%(tenant)s$sentinal$`` Related options: * cinder_store_auth_address * cinder_store_user_name * cinder_store_project_name * cinder_store_password * cinder_catalog_info
   * - ``cinder_http_retries`` = ``3``
     - (Integer) Number of cinderclient retries on failed http calls.$sentinal$When a call failed by any errors, cinderclient will retry the call up to the specified times after sleeping a few seconds.$sentinal$Possible values: * A positive integer$sentinal$Related options: * None
   * - ``cinder_os_region_name`` = ``None``
     - (String) Region name to lookup cinder service from the service catalog.$sentinal$This is used only when ``cinder_catalog_info`` is used for determining the endpoint. If set, the lookup for cinder endpoint by this node is filtered to the specified region. It is useful when multiple regions are listed in the catalog. If this is not set, the endpoint is looked up from every region.$sentinal$Possible values: * A string that is a valid region name.$sentinal$Related options: * cinder_catalog_info
   * - ``cinder_state_transition_timeout`` = ``300``
     - (Integer) Time period, in seconds, to wait for a cinder volume transition to complete.$sentinal$When the cinder volume is created, deleted, or attached to the glance node to read/write the volume data, the volume's state is changed. For example, the newly created volume status changes from ``creating`` to ``available`` after the creation process is completed. This specifies the maximum time to wait for the status change. If a timeout occurs while waiting, or the status is changed to an unexpected value (e.g. `error``), the image creation fails.$sentinal$Possible values: * A positive integer$sentinal$Related options: * None
   * - ``cinder_store_auth_address`` = ``None``
     - (String) The address where the cinder authentication service is listening.$sentinal$When all of ``cinder_store_auth_address``, ``cinder_store_user_name``, ``cinder_store_project_name``, and ``cinder_store_password`` options are specified, the specified values are always used for the authentication. This is useful to hide the image volumes from users by storing them in a project/tenant specific to the image service. It also enables users to share the image volume among other projects under the control of glance's ACL.$sentinal$If either of these options are not set, the cinder endpoint is looked up from the service catalog, and current context's user and project are used.$sentinal$Possible values: * A valid authentication service address, for example: ``http://openstack.example.org/identity/v2.0`` $sentinal$ Related options: * cinder_store_user_name * cinder_store_password * cinder_store_project_name
   * - ``cinder_store_password`` = ``None``
     - (String) Password for the user authenticating against cinder.$sentinal$This must be used with all the following related options. If any of these are not specified, the user of the current context is used.$sentinal$Possible values: * A valid password for the user specified by ``cinder_store_user_name$sentinal$`` Related options: * cinder_store_auth_address * cinder_store_user_name * cinder_store_project_name
   * - ``cinder_store_project_name`` = ``None``
     - (String) Project name where the image volume is stored in cinder.$sentinal$If this configuration option is not set, the project in current context is used.$sentinal$This must be used with all the following related options. If any of these are not specified, the project of the current context is used.$sentinal$Possible values: * A valid project name$sentinal$Related options: * ``cinder_store_auth_address`` * ``cinder_store_user_name`` * ``cinder_store_password``
   * - ``cinder_store_user_name`` = ``None``
     - (String) User name to authenticate against cinder.$sentinal$This must be used with all the following related options. If any of these are not specified, the user of the current context is used.$sentinal$Possible values: * A valid user name$sentinal$Related options: * cinder_store_auth_address * cinder_store_password * cinder_store_project_name

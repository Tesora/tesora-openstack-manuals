============================
Nimble Storage volume driver
============================

Nimble Storage fully integrates with the OpenStack platform through
the Nimble Cinder driver, allowing a host to configure and manage Nimble
Storage array features through Block Storage interfaces.

Support for the Liberty release is available from Nimble OS 2.3.8 or later.

Supported operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Create, delete, clone, attach, and detach volumes

* Create and delete volume snapshots

* Create a volume from a snapshot

* Copy an image to a volume

* Copy a volume to an image

* Extend a volume

* Get volume statistics

* Manage and unmanage a volume

* Enable encryption and default performance policy for a volume-type
  extra-specs

* Force backup of an in-use volume.

.. note::

   The Nimble Storage implementation uses iSCSI only.
   Fibre Channel is not supported.

Nimble Storage driver configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update the file ``/etc/cinder/cinder.conf`` with the given configuration.

In case of a basic (single back-end) configuration, add the parameters
within the ``[default]`` section as follows.

.. code-block:: ini

   [default]
   san_ip = NIMBLE_MGMT_IP
   san_login = NIMBLE_USER
   san_password = NIMBLE_PASSWORD
   volume_driver = cinder.volume.drivers.nimble.NimbleISCSIDriver

In case of multiple back-end configuration, for example, configuration
which supports multiple Nimble Storage arrays or a single Nimble Storage
array with arrays from other vendors, use the following parameters.

.. code-block:: ini

   [default]
   enabled_backends = Nimble-Cinder

   [Nimble-Cinder]
   san_ip = NIMBLE_MGMT_IP
   san_login = NIMBLE_USER
   san_password = NIMBLE_PASSWORD
   volume_driver = cinder.volume.drivers.nimble.NimbleISCSIDriver
   volume_backend_name = NIMBLE_BACKEND_NAME

In case of multiple back-end configuration, Nimble Storage volume type
is created and associated with a back-end name as follows.

.. note::

   Single back-end configuration users do not need to create the volume type.

.. code-block:: console

   $ cinder type-create NIMBLE_VOLUME_TYPE
   $ cinder type-key NIMBLE_VOLUME_TYPE set volume_backend_name=NIMBLE_BACKEND_NAME

This section explains the variables used above:

NIMBLE_MGMT_IP
  Management IP address of Nimble Storage array/group.

NIMBLE_USER
  Nimble Storage account login with minimum ``power user`` (admin) privilege
  if RBAC is used.

NIMBLE_PASSWORD
  Password of the admin account for nimble array.

NIMBLE_BACKEND_NAME
  A volume back-end name which is specified in the ``cinder.conf`` file.
  This is also used while assigning a back-end name to the Nimble volume type.

NIMBLE_VOLUME_TYPE
  The Nimble volume-type which is created from the CLI and associated with
  ``NIMBLE_BACKEND_NAME``.

  .. note::

     Restart the ``cinder-api``, ``cinder-scheduler``, and ``cinder-volume``
     services after updating the ``cinder.conf`` file.

Nimble driver extra spec options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Nimble volume driver also supports the following extra spec options:

'nimble:encryption'='yes'
  Used to enable encryption for a volume-type.

'nimble:perfpol-name'=PERF_POL_NAME
  PERF_POL_NAME is the name of a performance policy which exists on the
  Nimble array and should be enabled for every volume in a volume type.

'nimble:multi-initiator'='true'
  Used to enable multi-initiator access for a volume-type.

These extra-specs can be enabled by using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cinder type-key VOLUME_TYPE set KEY=VALUE

``VOLUME_TYPE`` is the Nimble volume type and ``KEY`` and ``VALUE`` are
the options mentioned above.

Configuration options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Nimble storage driver supports these configuration options:

.. include:: ../../tables/cinder-nimble.rst

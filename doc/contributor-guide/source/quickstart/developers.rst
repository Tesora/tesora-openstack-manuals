When you are writing a new feature for a component of OpenStack, it is
important that you also document that new feature. This is also true if you
are adding or changing configuration options, commands, or other user-
facing components.

Many of these types of changes are handled automatically by
`openstack-doc-tools`, and published to the Configuration Reference
and Command Line Reference Guides. For more information about these automated
tools, see the :ref:`doc-tools` chapter.

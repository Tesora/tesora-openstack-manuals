Support and maintenance
=======================

To be able to support and maintain an installation, OpenStack cloud
management requires operations staff to understand and comprehend design
architecture content. The operations and engineering staff skill level,
and level of separation, are dependent on size and purpose of the
installation. Large cloud service providers, or telecom providers, are
more likely to be managed by specially trained, dedicated operations
organizations. Smaller implementations are more likely to rely on
support staff that need to take on combined engineering, design and
operations functions.

Maintaining OpenStack installations requires a variety of technical
skills. You may want to consider using a third-party management company
with special expertise in managing OpenStack deployment.

Support and maintenance
=======================

In order to support, manage, and maintain an OpenStack installation,
you need an operations staff that understands the architecture. The
operations and engineering staff skill levels are dependent on the
size and purpose of your installation.
Large cloud service providers, or telecommunication providers, are
more likely to be managed by specially trained, dedicated operations
staff. Smaller implementations are more likely to rely on
support staff that will take on combined engineering, design and
operations functions.

Maintaining OpenStack installations requires a variety of technical
skills. You may want to consider using a third-party management company
with special expertise in managing an OpenStack deployment.

Skills and training
===================

Projecting growth for storage, networking, and compute is only one aspect of a
growth plan for running OpenStack at massive scale. Growing and nurturing
development and operational staff is an additional consideration. Sending team
members to OpenStack conferences, meetup events, and encouraging active
participation in the mailing lists and committees is a very important way to
maintain skills and forge relationships in the community. For a list of
OpenStack training providers in the marketplace, see:

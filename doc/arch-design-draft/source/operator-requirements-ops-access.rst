==========================
Operator access to systems
==========================

As more and more applications are migrated into a Cloud based environment, we
get to a position where systems that are critical for Cloud operations are
hosted within the cloud that is being operated.  Consideration must be given to
the ability for operators to be able to access the systems and tools required
in order to resolve a major incident.

If a significant portion of the cloud is on externally managed systems,
prepare for situations where it may not be possible to make changes.
Additionally, providers may differ on how infrastructure must be managed and
exposed. This can lead to delays in root cause analysis where each insists the
blame lies with the other provider.

Ensure that the network structure connects all clouds to form an integrated
system, keeping in mind the state of handoffs. These handoffs must both be as
reliable as possible and include as little latency as possible to ensure the
best performance of the overall system.

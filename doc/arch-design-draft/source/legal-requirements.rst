==================
Legal requirements
==================

Most countries have legislative and regulatory requirements governing
the storage and management of data in cloud environments. This is particularly
relevant for public, community and hybrid cloud models, to ensure data privacy
and protection for organizations using a third party cloud provider.

.. TODO Elaborate and refine this section later.

Common areas of regulation include:

* Data retention policies ensuring storage of persistent data
  and records management to meet data archival requirements.
* Data ownership policies governing the possession and
  responsibility for data.
* Data sovereignty policies governing the storage of data in
  foreign countries or otherwise separate jurisdictions.
* Data compliance policies governing certain types of
  information needing to reside in certain locations due to
  regulatory issues - and more importantly, cannot reside in
  other locations for the same reason.

Examples of such legal frameworks include the
`data protection framework <http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/>`_
of the European Union, and the requirements of the
`Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
<http://www.finra.org/Industry/Regulation/FINRARules/>`_
in the United States.
Consult a local regulatory body for more information.

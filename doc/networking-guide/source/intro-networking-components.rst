Switches
~~~~~~~~

A switch is a device that is used to connect devices on a network.
Switches forward packets on to other devices, using packet switching to
pass data along only to devices that need to receive it. Switches operate
at layer 2 of the OSI model.

Routers
~~~~~~~

A router is a networking device that connects multiple networks
together. Routers are connected to two or more networks. When they
receive data packets, they use a routing table to determine which
networks to pass the information to.

Firewalls
~~~~~~~~~

A firewall is a network device that controls the incoming and outgoing
network traffic based on an applied rule set.

Load balancers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A load balancer is a network device that distributes network or application
traffic across a number of servers.

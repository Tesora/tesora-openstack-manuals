===============
Data collection
===============

The main responsibility of Telemetry in OpenStack is to collect
information about the system that can be used by billing systems or
interpreted by analytic tooling. Telemetry in OpenStack originally focused
on the counters used for billing, and the recorded range is
continuously growing wider.

Collected data can be stored in the form of samples or events in the
supported databases, which are listed
in :ref:`telemetry-supported-databases`.

Samples can have various sources. Sample sources depend on, and adapt to,
the needs and configuration of Telemetry. The Telemetry service requires
multiple methods to collect data samples.

The available data collection mechanisms are:

Notifications
    Processing notifications from other OpenStack services, by consuming
    messages from the configured message queue system.

Polling
    Retrieve information directly from the hypervisor or from the host
    machine using SNMP, or by using the APIs of other OpenStack
    services.

RESTful API
    Pushing samples via the RESTful API of Telemetry.

Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All OpenStack services send notifications about the executed operations
or system state. Several notifications carry information that can be
metered. For example, CPU time of a VM instance created by OpenStack
Compute service.

The notification agent works alongside, but separately, from the
Telemetry service. The agent is responsible for consuming notifications.
This component is responsible for consuming from the message bus and
transforming notifications into events and measurement samples.

Since the Liberty release, the notification agent is responsible
for all data processing such as transformations and publishing. After
processing, the data is sent via AMQP to the collector service or any
external service. These external services persist the data in
configured databases.

The different OpenStack services emit several notifications about the
various types of events that happen in the system during normal
operation. Not all these notifications are consumed by the Telemetry
service, as the intention is only to capture the billable events and
notifications that can be used for monitoring or profiling purposes. The
notification agent filters by the event type. Each notification
message contains the event type. The following table contains the event
types by each OpenStack service that Telemetry transforms into samples.

       in the Installation Tutorials and Guides.

.. note::

   Some services require additional configuration to emit the
   notifications using the correct control exchange on the message
   queue and so forth. These configuration needs are referred in the
   above table for each OpenStack service that needs it.

Specific notifications from the Compute service are important for
administrators and users. Configuring ``nova_notifications`` in the
``nova.conf`` file allows administrators to respond to events
rapidly. For more information on configuring notifications for the
compute service, see
`Telemetry services <http://docs.openstack.org/project-install-guide/
telemetry/newton/configure_services/nova/install-nova-ubuntu.html>`__ in the
Installation Tutorials and Guides.

.. note::

   When the ``store_events`` option is set to ``True`` in
   ``ceilometer.conf``, Prior to the Kilo release, the notification agent
   needed database access in order to work properly.

Compute agent
-------------

This agent is responsible for collecting resource usage data of VM
instances on individual Compute nodes within an OpenStack deployment.
This mechanism requires a closer interaction with the hypervisor,
therefore a separate agent type fulfills the collection of the related
meters, which is placed on the host machines to retrieve this
information locally.

A Compute agent instance has to be installed on each and every compute
node, installation instructions can be found in the `Install the Compute
agent for Telemetry
<http://docs.openstack.org/project-install-guide/
telemetry/newton/configure_services/nova/install-nova-ubuntu.html>`__
section in the Installation Tutorials and Guides.

Just like the central agent, this component also does not need a direct
database connection. The samples are sent via AMQP to the notification agent.

The list of supported hypervisors can be found in
:ref:`telemetry-supported-hypervisors`. The Compute agent uses the API of the
hypervisor installed on the Compute hosts. Therefore, the supported meters may
be different in case of each virtualization back end, as each inspection tool
provides a different set of meters.

The list of collected meters can be found in :ref:`telemetry-compute-meters`.
The support column provides the information about which meter is available for
each hypervisor supported by the Telemetry service.

.. note::

    Telemetry supports Libvirt, which hides the hypervisor under it.

Middleware for the OpenStack Object Storage service
---------------------------------------------------

A subset of Object Store statistics requires additional middleware to
be installed behind the proxy of Object Store. This additional component
emits notifications containing data-flow-oriented meters, namely the
``storage.objects.(incoming|outgoing).bytes values``. The list of these
meters are listed in :ref:`telemetry-object-storage-meter`, marked with
``notification`` as origin.

The instructions on how to install this middleware can be found in
`Configure the Object Storage service for Telemetry
<http://docs.openstack.org/project-install-guide/
telemetry/newton/configure_services/swift/install-swift-ubuntu.html>`__
section in the Installation Tutorials and Guides.

Telemetry middleware
--------------------

Telemetry provides HTTP request and API endpoint counting
capability in OpenStack. This is achieved by
storing a sample for each event marked as ``audit.http.request``,
``audit.http.response``, ``http.request`` or ``http.response``.

It is recommended that these notifications be consumed as events rather
than samples to better index the appropriate values and avoid massive
load on the Metering database. If preferred, Telemetry can consume these
events as samples if the services are configured to emit ``http.*``
notifications.

Polling
~~~~~~~

The Telemetry service is intended to store a complex picture of the
infrastructure. This goal requires additional information than what is
provided by the events and notifications published by each service. Some
information is not emitted directly, like resource usage of the VM
instances.

Therefore Telemetry uses another method to gather this data by polling
the infrastructure including the APIs of the different OpenStack
services and other assets, like hypervisors. The latter case requires
closer interaction with the Compute hosts. To solve this issue,
Telemetry uses an agent based architecture to fulfill the requirements
against the data collection.

There are three types of agents supporting the polling mechanism, the
``compute agent``, the ``central agent``, and the ``IPMI agent``. Under
the hood, all the types of polling agents are the same
``ceilometer-polling`` agent, except that they load different polling
plug-ins (pollsters) from different namespaces to gather data. The following
subsections give further information regarding the architectural and
configuration details of these components.

Running :command:`ceilometer-agent-compute` is exactly the same as:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ceilometer-polling --polling-namespaces compute

Running :command:`ceilometer-agent-central` is exactly the same as:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ceilometer-polling --polling-namespaces central

Running :command:`ceilometer-agent-ipmi` is exactly the same as:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ceilometer-polling --polling-namespaces ipmi

In addition to loading all the polling plug-ins registered in the
specified namespaces, the ``ceilometer-polling`` agent can also specify the
polling plug-ins to be loaded by using the ``pollster-list`` option:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ceilometer-polling --polling-namespaces central \
           --pollster-list image image.size storage.*

.. note::

   HA deployment is NOT supported if the ``pollster-list`` option is
   used.

.. note::

   The ``ceilometer-polling`` service is available since Kilo release.

Central agent
-------------

This agent is responsible for polling public REST APIs to retrieve additional
information on OpenStack resources not already surfaced via notifications,
and also for polling hardware resources over SNMP.

The following services can be polled with this agent:

-  OpenStack Networking

-  OpenStack Object Storage

-  OpenStack Block Storage

-  Hardware resources via SNMP

-  Energy consumption meters via `Kwapi <https://launchpad.net/kwapi>`__
   framework

To install and configure this service use the `Add the Telemetry service
<http://docs.openstack.org/project-install-guide/telemetry/newton/install-base-ubuntu.html>`__
section in the Installation Tutorials and Guides.

The central agent does not need direct database connection. The samples
collected by this agent are sent via AMQP to the notification agent to be
processed.

.. note::

   Prior to the Liberty release, data from the polling agents was processed
   locally and published accordingly rather than by the notification agent.

.. _telemetry-ipmi-agent:

IPMI agent
----------

This agent is responsible for collecting IPMI sensor data and Intel Node
Manager data on individual Compute nodes within an OpenStack deployment.
This agent requires an IPMI capable node with the ipmitool utility installed,
which is commonly used for IPMI control on various Linux distributions.

An IPMI agent instance could be installed on each and every Compute node
with IPMI support, except when the node is managed by the Bare metal
service and the ``conductor.send_sensor_data`` option is set to ``true``
in the Bare metal service. It is no harm to install this agent on a
Compute node without IPMI or Intel Node Manager support, as the agent
checks for the hardware and if none is available, returns empty data. It
is suggested that you install the IPMI agent only on an IPMI capable
node for performance reasons.

Just like the central agent, this component also does not need direct
database access. The samples are sent via AMQP to the notification agent.

The list of collected meters can be found in
:ref:`telemetry-bare-metal-service`.

.. note::

   Do not deploy both the IPMI agent and the Bare metal service on one
   compute node. If ``conductor.send_sensor_data`` is set, this
   misconfiguration causes duplicated IPMI sensor samples.


.. _ha-deploy-services:

Support for HA deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Both the polling agents and notification agents can run in an HA deployment,
which means that multiple instances of these services can run in
parallel with workload partitioning among these running instances.

The `Tooz <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tooz>`__ library provides the
coordination within the groups of service instances. It provides an API
above several back ends that can be used for building distributed
applications.

Tooz supports `various
drivers <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/tooz/drivers.html>`__
including the following back end solutions:

-  `Zookeeper <http://zookeeper.apache.org/>`__. Recommended solution by
   the Tooz project.

-  `Redis <http://redis.io/>`__. Recommended solution by the Tooz
   project.

-  `Memcached <http://memcached.org/>`__. Recommended for testing.

You must configure a supported Tooz driver for the HA deployment of the
Telemetry services.

For information about the required configuration options that have to be
set in the ``ceilometer.conf`` configuration file for both the central
and Compute agents, see the `Coordination section
<http://docs.openstack.org/newton/config-reference/telemetry/telemetry-config-options.html>`__
in the OpenStack Configuration Reference.

Notification agent HA deployment
--------------------------------

In the Kilo release, workload partitioning support was added to the
notification agent. This is particularly useful as the pipeline processing
is handled exclusively by the notification agent now which may result
in a larger amount of load.

To enable workload partitioning by notification agent, the ``backend_url``
option must be set in the ``ceilometer.conf`` configuration file.
Additionally, ``workload_partitioning`` should be enabled in the
`Notification section <http://docs.openstack.org/newton/config-reference/telemetry/telemetry-config-options.html>`__ in the OpenStack Configuration Reference.

.. note::

   In Liberty, the notification agent creates multiple queues to divide the
   workload across all active agents. The number of queues can be controlled by
   the ``pipeline_processing_queues`` option in the ``ceilometer.conf``
   configuration file. A larger value will result in better distribution of
   tasks but will also require more memory and longer startup time. It is
   recommended to have a value approximately three times the number of active
   notification agents. At a minimum, the value should be equal to the number
   of active agents.

Polling agent HA deployment
---------------------------

.. note::

    Without the ``backend_url`` option being set only one instance of
    both the central and Compute agent service is able to run and
    function correctly.

The availability check of the instances is provided by heartbeat
messages. When the connection with an instance is lost, the workload
will be reassigned within the remained instances in the next polling
cycle.

.. note::

    ``Memcached`` uses a ``timeout`` value, which should always be set
    to a value that is higher than the ``heartbeat`` value set for
    Telemetry.

For backward compatibility and supporting existing deployments, the
central agent configuration also supports using different configuration
files for groups of service instances of this type that are running in
parallel. For enabling this configuration set a value for the
``partitioning_group_prefix`` option in the `polling section
<http://docs.openstack.org/newton/config-reference/telemetry/telemetry-config-options.html>`__
in the OpenStack Configuration Reference.

.. warning::

    For each sub-group of the central agent pool with the same
    ``partitioning_group_prefix`` a disjoint subset of meters must be
    polled, otherwise samples may be missing or duplicated. The list of
    meters to poll can be set in the ``/etc/ceilometer/pipeline.yaml``
    configuration file. For more information about pipelines see
    :ref:`data-collection-and-processing`.

To enable the Compute agent to run multiple instances simultaneously
with workload partitioning, the ``workload_partitioning`` option has to
be set to ``True`` under the `Compute section
<http://docs.openstack.org/newton/config-reference/telemetry/telemetry-config-options.html>`__
in the ``ceilometer.conf`` configuration file.


Send samples to Telemetry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While most parts of the data collection in the Telemetry service are
automated, Telemetry provides the possibility to submit samples via the
REST API to allow users to send custom samples into this service.

This option makes it possible to send any kind of samples without the
need of writing extra code lines or making configuration changes.

The samples that can be sent to Telemetry are not limited to the actual
existing meters. There is a possibility to provide data for any new,
customer defined counter by filling out all the required fields of the
POST request.

If the sample corresponds to an existing meter, then the fields like
``meter-type`` and meter name should be matched accordingly.

The required fields for sending a sample using the command-line client
are:

-  ID of the corresponding resource. (:option:`--resource-id`)

-  Name of meter. (:option:`--meter-name`)

-  Type of meter. (:option:`--meter-type`)

   Predefined meter types:

   -  Gauge

   -  Delta

   -  Cumulative

-  Unit of meter. (:option:`--meter-unit`)

-  Volume of sample. (:option:`--sample-volume`)

To send samples to Telemetry using the command-line client, the
following command should be invoked:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ceilometer sample-create -r 37128ad6-daaa-4d22-9509-b7e1c6b08697 \
     -m memory.usage --meter-type gauge --meter-unit MB --sample-volume 48

.. _telemetry-meter-definitions:

Meter definitions
-----------------
The Telemetry service collects a subset of the meters by filtering
notifications emitted by other OpenStack services. Starting with the Liberty
release, you can find the meter definitions in a separate configuration file,
called ``ceilometer/meter/data/meter.yaml``. This enables
operators/administrators to add new meters to Telemetry project by updating
the ``meter.yaml`` file without any need for additional code changes.

.. note::

   The ``meter.yaml`` file should be modified with care. Unless intended
   do not remove any existing meter definitions from the file. Also, the
   collected meters can differ in some cases from what is referenced in the
   documentation.

A standard meter definition looks like:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   metric:
     - name: 'meter name'
       event_type: 'event name'
       type: 'type of meter eg: gauge, cumulative or delta'
       unit: 'name of unit eg: MB'
       volume: 'path to a measurable value eg: $.payload.size'
       resource_id: 'path to resource id eg: $.payload.id'
       project_id: 'path to project id eg: $.payload.owner'

The definition above shows a simple meter definition with some fields,
from which ``name``, ``event_type``, ``type``, ``unit``, and ``volume``
are required. If there is a match on the event type, samples are generated
for the meter.

If you take a look at the ``meter.yaml`` file, it contains the sample
definitions for all the meters that Telemetry is collecting from
notifications. The value of each field is specified by using JSON path in
order to find the right value from the notification message. In order to be
able to specify the right field you need to be aware of the format of the
consumed notification. The values that need to be searched in the notification
message are set with a JSON path starting with ``$.`` For instance, if you need
the ``size`` information from the payload you can define it like
``$.payload.size``.

A notification message may contain multiple meters. You can use ``*`` in
the meter definition to capture all the meters and generate samples
respectively. You can use wild cards as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   metric:
     - name: $.payload.measurements.[*].metric.[*].name
       event_type: 'event_name.*'
       type: 'delta'
       unit: $.payload.measurements.[*].metric.[*].unit
       volume: payload.measurements.[*].result
       resource_id: $.payload.target
       user_id: $.payload.initiator.id
       project_id: $.payload.initiator.project_id

In the above example, the ``name`` field is a JSON path with matching
a list of meter names defined in the notification message.

You can even use complex operations on JSON paths. In the following example,
``volume`` and ``resource_id`` fields perform an arithmetic
and string concatenation:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   metric:
   - name: 'compute.node.cpu.idle.percent'
     event_type: 'compute.metrics.update'
     type: 'gauge'
     unit: 'percent'
     volume: payload.metrics[?(@.name='cpu.idle.percent')].value * 100
     resource_id: $.payload.host + "_" + $.payload.nodename

You can use the ``timedelta`` plug-in to evaluate the difference in seconds
between two ``datetime`` fields from one notification.

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   metric:
   - name: 'compute.instance.booting.time'
     event_type: 'compute.instance.create.end'
    type: 'gauge'
    unit: 'sec'
    volume:
      fields: [$.payload.created_at, $.payload.launched_at]
      plugin: 'timedelta'
    project_id: $.payload.tenant_id
    resource_id: $.payload.instance_id

You will find some existence meters in the ``meter.yaml``. These
meters have a ``volume`` as ``1`` and are at the bottom of the yaml file
with a note suggesting that these will be removed in Mitaka release.

For example, the meter definition for existence meters is as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   metric:
     - name: 'meter name'
       type: 'delta'
       unit: 'volume'
       volume: 1
       event_type:
           - 'event type'
       resource_id: $.payload.volume_id
       user_id: $.payload.user_id
       project_id: $.payload.tenant_id

These meters are not loaded by default. To load these meters, flip
the `disable_non_metric_meters` option in the ``ceilometer.conf``
file.

Block Storage audit script setup to get notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to collect OpenStack Block Storage notification on demand,
you can use :command:`cinder-volume-usage-audit` from OpenStack Block Storage.
This script becomes available when you install OpenStack Block Storage,
so you can use it without any specific settings and you don't need to
authenticate to access the data. To use it, you must run this command in
the following format:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cinder-volume-usage-audit \
     --start_time='YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' --end_time='YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' --send_actions

This script outputs what volumes or snapshots were created, deleted, or
exists in a given period of time and some information about these
volumes or snapshots. Information about the existence and size of
volumes and snapshots is store in the Telemetry service. This data is
also stored as an event which is the recommended usage as it provides
better indexing of data.

Using this script via cron you can get notifications periodically, for
example, every 5 minutes::

    */5 * * * * /path/to/cinder-volume-usage-audit --send_actions

.. _telemetry-storing-samples:

Storing samples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Telemetry service has a separate service that is responsible for
persisting the data that comes from the pollsters or is received as
notifications. The data can be stored in a file or a database back end,
for which the list of supported databases can be found in
:ref:`telemetry-supported-databases`. The data can also be sent to an external
data store by using an HTTP dispatcher.

The ``ceilometer-collector`` service receives the data as messages from the
message bus of the configured AMQP service. It sends these datapoints
without any modification to the configured target. The service has to
run on a host machine from which it has access to the configured
dispatcher.

.. note::

   Multiple dispatchers can be configured for Telemetry at one time.

Multiple ``ceilometer-collector`` processes can be run at a time. It is also
supported to start multiple worker threads per collector process. The
``collector_workers`` configuration option has to be modified in the
`Collector section
<http://docs.openstack.org/newton/config-reference/telemetry/telemetry-config-options.html>`__
of the ``ceilometer.conf`` configuration file.

Database dispatcher
-------------------

When the database dispatcher is configured as data store, you have the
option to set a ``time_to_live`` option (ttl) for samples. By default
the time to live value for samples is set to -1, which means that they
are kept in the database forever.

The time to live value is specified in seconds. Each sample has a time
stamp, and the ``ttl`` value indicates that a sample will be deleted
from the database when the number of seconds has elapsed since that
sample reading was stamped. For example, if the time to live is set to
600, all samples older than 600 seconds will be purged from the
database.

Certain databases support native TTL expiration. In cases where this is
not possible, a command-line script, which you can use for this purpose
is ``ceilometer-expirer``. You can run it in a cron job, which helps to keep
your database in a consistent state.

The level of support differs in case of the configured back end:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 33 33
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Database
     - TTL value support
     - Note
   * - MongoDB
     - Yes
     - MongoDB has native TTL support for deleting samples
       that are older than the configured ttl value.
   * - SQL-based back ends
     - Yes
     - ``ceilometer-expirer`` has to be used for deleting
       samples and its related data from the database.
   * - HBase
     - No
     - Telemetry's HBase support does not include native TTL
       nor ``ceilometer-expirer`` support.
   * - DB2 NoSQL

HTTP dispatcher
---------------

The Telemetry service supports sending samples to an external HTTP
target. The samples are sent without any modification. To set this
option as the collector's target, the ``dispatcher`` has to be changed
to ``http`` in the ``ceilometer.conf`` configuration file. For the list
of options that you need to set, see the see the `dispatcher_http
section <http://docs.openstack.org/newton/config-reference/telemetry/telemetry-config-options.html>`__
in the OpenStack Configuration Reference.

File dispatcher
---------------

You can store samples in a file by setting the ``dispatcher`` option in the
``ceilometer.conf`` file. For the list of configuration options,
see the `dispatcher_file section
<http://docs.openstack.org/newton/config-reference/telemetry/telemetry-config-options.html>`__
in the OpenStack Configuration Reference.

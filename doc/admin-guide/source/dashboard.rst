The OpenStack Dashboard is a web-based interface that allows you to
manage OpenStack resources and services. The Dashboard allows you to
interact with the OpenStack Compute cloud controller using the OpenStack
APIs. For more information about installing and configuring the
Dashboard, see the `Installation Tutorials and Guides
<http://docs.openstack.org/project-install-guide/newton/>`__
for your operating system.

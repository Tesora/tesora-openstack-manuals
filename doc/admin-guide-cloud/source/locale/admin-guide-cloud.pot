"The Bare Metal service provides physical hardware as opposed to virtual "

"technologies like PXE and IPMI, to cover a wide range of hardware. The "
"pluggable driver architecture also allows vendor-specific drivers to be "

"drivers. The Bare Metal service makes physical servers as easy to provision "
"as virtual machines in a cloud, which in turn will open up new avenues for "

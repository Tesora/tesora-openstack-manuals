.. list-table:: Description of Qpid configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[oslo_messaging_qpid]**
     -
   * - ``amqp_auto_delete`` = ``False``
     - (BoolOpt) Auto-delete queues in AMQP.
   * - ``amqp_durable_queues`` = ``False``
     - (BoolOpt) Use durable queues in AMQP.
   * - ``qpid_heartbeat`` = ``60``
     - (IntOpt) Seconds between connection keepalive heartbeats.
   * - ``qpid_hostname`` = ``localhost``
     - (StrOpt) Qpid broker hostname.
   * - ``qpid_hosts`` = ``$qpid_hostname:$qpid_port``
     - (ListOpt) Qpid HA cluster host:port pairs.
   * - ``qpid_password`` =
     - (StrOpt) Password for Qpid connection.
   * - ``qpid_port`` = ``5672``
     - (IntOpt) Qpid broker port.
   * - ``qpid_protocol`` = ``tcp``
     - (StrOpt) Transport to use, either 'tcp' or 'ssl'.
   * - ``qpid_receiver_capacity`` = ``1``
     - (IntOpt) The number of prefetched messages held by receiver.
   * - ``qpid_sasl_mechanisms`` =
     - (StrOpt) Space separated list of SASL mechanisms to use for auth.
   * - ``qpid_tcp_nodelay`` = ``True``
     - (BoolOpt) Whether to disable the Nagle algorithm.
   * - ``qpid_topology_version`` = ``1``
     - (IntOpt) The qpid topology version to use. Version 1 is what was originally used by impl_qpid. Version 2 includes some backwards-incompatible changes that allow broker federation to work. Users should update to version 2 when they are able to take everything down, as it requires a clean break.
   * - ``qpid_username`` =
     - (StrOpt) Username for Qpid connection.
   * - ``send_single_reply`` = ``False``
     - (BoolOpt) Send a single AMQP reply to call message. The current behaviour since oslo-incubator is to send two AMQP replies - first one with the payload, a second one to ensure the other have finish to send the payload. We are going to remove it in the N release, but we must keep backward compatible at the same time. This option provides such compatibility - it defaults to False in Liberty and can be turned on for early adopters with a new installations or for testing. Please note, that this option will be removed in the Mitaka release.

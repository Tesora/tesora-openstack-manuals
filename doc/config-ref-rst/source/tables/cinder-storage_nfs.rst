   * - ``nfs_sparsed_volumes`` = ``True``

   * - ``nfs_used_ratio`` = ``0.95``
     - (FloatOpt) Percent of ACTUAL usage of the underlying volume before no new volumes can be allocated to the volume destination. Note that this option is deprecated in favor of "reserved_percentage" and will be removed in the Mitaka release.

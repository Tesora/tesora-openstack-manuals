.. list-table:: Description of RabbitMQ configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[oslo_messaging_rabbit]**
     -
   * - ``amqp_auto_delete`` = ``False``
     - (BoolOpt) Auto-delete queues in AMQP.
   * - ``amqp_durable_queues`` = ``False``
     - (BoolOpt) Use durable queues in AMQP.
   * - ``fake_rabbit`` = ``False``
     - (BoolOpt) Deprecated, use rpc_backend=kombu+memory or rpc_backend=fake
   * - ``heartbeat_rate`` = ``2``
     - (IntOpt) How often times during the heartbeat_timeout_threshold we check the heartbeat.
   * - ``heartbeat_timeout_threshold`` = ``60``
     - (IntOpt) Number of seconds after which the Rabbit broker is considered down if heartbeat's keep-alive fails (0 disable the heartbeat). EXPERIMENTAL
   * - ``kombu_reconnect_delay`` = ``1.0``
     - (FloatOpt) How long to wait before reconnecting in response to an AMQP consumer cancel notification.
   * - ``kombu_reconnect_timeout`` = ``60``
     - (IntOpt) How long to wait before considering a reconnect attempt to have failed. This value should not be longer than rpc_response_timeout.
   * - ``kombu_ssl_ca_certs`` =
     - (StrOpt) SSL certification authority file (valid only if SSL enabled).
   * - ``kombu_ssl_certfile`` =
     - (StrOpt) SSL cert file (valid only if SSL enabled).
   * - ``kombu_ssl_keyfile`` =
     - (StrOpt) SSL key file (valid only if SSL enabled).
   * - ``kombu_ssl_version`` =
     - (StrOpt) SSL version to use (valid only if SSL enabled). Valid values are TLSv1 and SSLv23. SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1_1, and TLSv1_2 may be available on some distributions.
   * - ``rabbit_ha_queues`` = ``False``
     - (BoolOpt) Use HA queues in RabbitMQ (x-ha-policy: all). If you change this option, you must wipe the RabbitMQ database.
   * - ``rabbit_host`` = ``localhost``
     - (StrOpt) The RabbitMQ broker address where a single node is used.
   * - ``rabbit_hosts`` = ``$rabbit_host:$rabbit_port``
     - (ListOpt) RabbitMQ HA cluster host:port pairs.
   * - ``rabbit_login_method`` = ``AMQPLAIN``
     - (StrOpt) The RabbitMQ login method.
   * - ``rabbit_max_retries`` = ``0``
     - (IntOpt) Maximum number of RabbitMQ connection retries. Default is 0 (infinite retry count).
   * - ``rabbit_password`` = ``guest``
     - (StrOpt) The RabbitMQ password.
   * - ``rabbit_port`` = ``5672``
     - (IntOpt) The RabbitMQ broker port where a single node is used.
   * - ``rabbit_retry_backoff`` = ``2``
     - (IntOpt) How long to backoff for between retries when connecting to RabbitMQ.
   * - ``rabbit_retry_interval`` = ``1``
     - (IntOpt) How frequently to retry connecting with RabbitMQ.
   * - ``rabbit_use_ssl`` = ``False``
     - (BoolOpt) Connect over SSL for RabbitMQ.
   * - ``rabbit_userid`` = ``guest``
     - (StrOpt) The RabbitMQ userid.
   * - ``rabbit_virtual_host`` = ``/``
     - (StrOpt) The RabbitMQ virtual host.
   * - ``send_single_reply`` = ``False``
     - (BoolOpt) Send a single AMQP reply to call message. The current behaviour since oslo-incubator is to send two AMQP replies - first one with the payload, a second one to ensure the other have finish to send the payload. We are going to remove it in the N release, but we must keep backward compatible at the same time. This option provides such compatibility - it defaults to False in Liberty and can be turned on for early adopters with a new installations or for testing. Please note, that this option will be removed in the Mitaka release.

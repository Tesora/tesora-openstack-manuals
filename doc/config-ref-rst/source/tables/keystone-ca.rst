   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[eventlet_server_ssl]**
     -
   * - ``ca_certs`` = ``/etc/keystone/ssl/certs/ca.pem``
     - (StrOpt) Path of the CA cert file for SSL.
   * - ``cert_required`` = ``False``
     - (BoolOpt) Require client certificate.
   * - ``certfile`` = ``/etc/keystone/ssl/certs/keystone.pem``
     - (StrOpt) Path of the certfile for SSL. For non-production environments, you may be interested in using `keystone-manage ssl_setup` to generate self-signed certificates.
   * - ``enable`` = ``False``
     - (BoolOpt) Toggle for SSL support on the Keystone eventlet servers.
   * - ``keyfile`` = ``/etc/keystone/ssl/private/keystonekey.pem``
     - (StrOpt) Path of the keyfile for SSL.
   * - **[signing]**
     -
   * - ``ca_certs`` = ``/etc/keystone/ssl/certs/ca.pem``
     - (StrOpt) Path of the CA for token signing.
   * - ``ca_key`` = ``/etc/keystone/ssl/private/cakey.pem``
     - (StrOpt) Path of the CA key for token signing.
   * - ``cert_subject`` = ``/C=US/ST=Unset/L=Unset/O=Unset/CN=www.example.com``
     - (StrOpt) Certificate subject (auto generated certificate) for token signing.
   * - ``certfile`` = ``/etc/keystone/ssl/certs/signing_cert.pem``
     - (StrOpt) Path of the certfile for token signing. For non-production environments, you may be interested in using `keystone-manage pki_setup` to generate self-signed certificates.
   * - ``key_size`` = ``2048``
     - (IntOpt) Key size (in bits) for token signing cert (auto generated certificate).
   * - ``keyfile`` = ``/etc/keystone/ssl/private/signing_key.pem``
     - (StrOpt) Path of the keyfile for token signing.
   * - ``valid_days`` = ``3650``
     - (IntOpt) Days the token signing cert is valid for (auto generated certificate).
   * - **[ssl]**
     -
   * - ``ca_key`` = ``/etc/keystone/ssl/private/cakey.pem``
     - (StrOpt) Path of the CA key file for SSL.
   * - ``cert_subject`` = ``/C=US/ST=Unset/L=Unset/O=Unset/CN=localhost``
     - (StrOpt) SSL certificate subject (auto generated certificate).
   * - ``key_size`` = ``1024``
     - (IntOpt) SSL key length (in bits) (auto generated certificate).
   * - ``valid_days`` = ``3650``
     - (IntOpt) Days the certificate is valid for once signed (auto generated certificate).

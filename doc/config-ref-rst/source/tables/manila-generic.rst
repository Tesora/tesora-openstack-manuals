     - (StrOpt) Info to match when looking for cinder in the service catalog. Format is separated values of the form: <service_type>:<service_name>:<endpoint_type>
   * - ``cinder_cross_az_attach`` = ``True``
     - (BoolOpt) Allow attaching between instances and volumes in different availability zones.
   * - ``cinder_http_retries`` = ``3``
     - (IntOpt) Number of cinderclient retries on failed HTTP calls.
   * - ``cinder_volume_type`` = ``None``

It is set to None by default to make this choice intentional.

.. list-table:: Description of policy configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[DEFAULT]**
     -
   * - ``allow_instance_snapshots`` = ``True``
     - (BoolOpt) Permit instance snapshot operations.
   * - ``allow_resize_to_same_host`` = ``False``
     - (BoolOpt) Allow destination machine to match source for resize. Useful when testing in single-host environments.
   * - ``max_age`` = ``0``
     - (IntOpt) Number of seconds between subsequent usage refreshes. This defaults to 0(off) to avoid additional load but it is useful to turn on to help keep quota usage up to date and reduce the impact of out of sync usage issues. Note that quotas are not updated on a periodic task, they will update on a new reservation if max_age has passed since the last reservation
   * - ``max_local_block_devices`` = ``3``
     - (IntOpt) Maximum number of devices that will result in a local image being created on the hypervisor node. A negative number means unlimited. Setting max_local_block_devices to 0 means that any request that attempts to create a local disk will fail. This option is meant to limit the number of local discs (so root local disc that is the result of --image being used, and any other ephemeral and swap disks). 0 does not mean that images will be automatically converted to volumes and boot instances from volumes - it just means that all requests that attempt to create a local disk will fail.
   * - ``osapi_compute_unique_server_name_scope`` =
     - (StrOpt) When set, compute API will consider duplicate hostnames invalid within the specified scope, regardless of case. Should be empty, "project" or "global".
   * - ``osapi_max_limit`` = ``1000``
     - (IntOpt) The maximum number of items returned in a single response from a collection resource
   * - ``password_length`` = ``12``
     - (IntOpt) Length of generated instance admin passwords
   * - ``policy_default_rule`` = ``default``
     - (StrOpt) Default rule. Enforced when a requested rule is not found.
   * - ``policy_dirs`` = ``['policy.d']``
     - (MultiStrOpt) Directories where policy configuration files are stored. They can be relative to any directory in the search path defined by the config_dir option, or absolute paths. The file defined by policy_file must exist for these directories to be searched. Missing or empty directories are ignored.
   * - ``policy_file`` = ``policy.json``
     - (StrOpt) The JSON file that defines policies.
   * - ``reservation_expire`` = ``86400``
     - (IntOpt) Number of seconds until a reservation expires
   * - ``resize_fs_using_block_device`` = ``False``
     - (BoolOpt) Attempt to resize the filesystem by accessing the image over a block device. This is done by the host and may not be necessary if the image contains a recent version of cloud-init. Possible mechanisms require the nbd driver (for qcow and raw), or loop (for raw).
   * - ``until_refresh`` = ``0``
     - (IntOpt) Count of reservations until usage is refreshed. This defaults to 0(off) to avoid additional load but it is useful to turn on to help keep quota usage up to date and reduce the impact of out of sync usage issues.

  <p><strong>The OpenStack Architecture Design Guide offers examples of OpenStack deployments for different use cases.</strong>
Authors who know how to design clouds that meet users' needs wrote this book in a five-day book sprint.</p>

   Read this book to learn about these types of use cases for OpenStack clouds:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    General purpose: compute, network, and storage components balanced for scale-out, general purpose applications.
   </li>
   <li>
    Compute focused: built and designed specifically to support compute intensive workloads such as high performance computing, big data analysis, continuous integration or continuous deployment, and Platform-as-a-Service.
   </li>
   <li>
    Storage focused: data management through cloud storage solutions to support applications like archiving, data analytics, content storage and synchronization, media streaming, databases, and content distribution.
   </li>
   <li>
    Network focused: when users require network services beyond the usual cloud use cases, such as content delivery networks, network services like VPN or GRE tunnels, and web portals or web services.
   </li>
   <li>
    Multi-site clouds: when services are hosted in more than one data center to spread out the geographic footprint for redundancy or for location-sensitive data
   </li>
   <li>
    Hybrid clouds: when the design spans more than one cloud, you plan for a hybrid cloud architecture.
   </li>
   <li>
    Massively scalable: for large deployments serving many users with many resources available, often for public clouds
   </li>
   <li>
    Specialized cases: describes multi-hypervisor examples, specialized networking, desktop-as-a-service, OpenStack on OpenStack, and the use of specialized hardware in a cloud's design.
   </li>
  </ul>
